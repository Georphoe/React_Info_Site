-Why React? composable and declarative
-JSX syntax
-custom component
-styling with css
-a static page


This project is my inaugural venture into React development. I opted for React due to its composable and declarative nature, as well as its wide adoption within the web development community. Throughout this project, I delved into the concept of JSX syntax, crafting my own custom React components, and implementing CSS styling to construct a static webpage. This served as an invaluable introduction to the fundamentals of React and laid the groundwork for my future endeavors in this powerful JavaScript library.
